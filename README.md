Reinforcement Learning using value iteration algorithm

Solve a finite state/action space MDP using the value iteration algorithm. Plot a heatmap showing the route to take to get to max expected value starting from any point in the action space.
"Solve" i.e. create policy and take steps that maximize expected value.
